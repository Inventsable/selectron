Revamp of Joystick Buddy -- a reactive selection tool that can recognize related layers within any AE composition and prompt for a custom script, expression injection or action on layers/props/relatives matching specified keywords.

The current screen component is only a visual indicator that the prototype recognizes relatives within a keyword family. The screen would instead show data about the total comp (if nothing selected) or "Rig Recipes", custom script snippets or expressions from a user-created library, if selection meets the recipe conditions (like an auto-rig action for eyebrows needing tags like 'Brow' and both directions, west and east or left and right).
